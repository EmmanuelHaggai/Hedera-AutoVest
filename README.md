## 💡 Vision

To democratize access to investments in Kenya and across Africa by connecting **AI-driven insights**, **tokenized stocks**, and **mobile payments** through a WhatsApp chat.  
We aim to empower millions of Africans to own real shares, trade transparently, and grow wealth seamlessly on Hedera.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Every stock on the **Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)** is **tokenized** via the **Hedera Token Service (HTS)**.
- Users can interact with the **AutoVest AI agent** directly on WhatsApp to:
  - Check wallet balances (`/bal`)
  - Buy or sell tokenized NSE stocks
  - Send or receive **HBAR** or **HKSH**
  - Subscribe to automated investments (daily, weekly, or monthly)
  - Purchase airtime or top up via **M-Pesa**
  - Complete **KYC** verification directly in WhatsApp
- All trades are **on-chain**, and every transaction generates an immutable **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** message receipt.

---

## 🧠 AI Architecture

Hedera AutoVest AI integrates a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** that converts live NSE stock prices into time-series data.  
It applies a **calibrated sigmoid curve** to predict short-term price movements and uses **AI web scrapers** to analyze live financial news.

This dual-engine allows the AI to:
- Perform **automated technical analysis**  
- Identify **profitable entry and exit points**  
- Execute trades in seconds with **data-driven precision**

---

## 💰 Tokenized Ecosystem

- **HKSH**: A Hedera-based utility token pegged 1:1 to the Kenyan shilling.  
- **NSE Stocks on Hedera**: Each listed company is represented by a tokenized asset for transparent, fractional ownership.  
- Users can easily convert between **HBAR** and **HKSH**, send assets, or invest automatically through the AI.

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Integrated **Stripe**, **Google OAuth**, and **SMS OTP** for multi-factor authentication.  
- **KYC workflows** built directly into the WhatsApp chat interface.  
- Transactions are **on-chain and auditable** through the **Hedera Consensus Service**.
